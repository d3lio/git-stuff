## Scripts

* `new` - Create a new branch { f, feature, x, fix, c, chore } e.g `git new feature branch-name`
* `ff` - Squash and rebase the feature branch on master then if `--merge` or `-m` are supplied try to fast forward it
* `fixup` - Find the latest non-fixup commit and create a fixup for it (Deprecated - Becomes one-liner with bash)
